# What I Learnt from 4 Years of College

College is supposed to be “the best four years of your life.” And honestly, sometimes it was… sometimes it wasn’t. Between late-night grind, last-minute submissions, unexpected failures, and those rare golden wins, I came out with more lessons than grades🤌.


## 1. Failures, CGPA & What Really Matters
If you haven’t failed in college, did you even go to college? 😂
Whether it’s flunking a test, messing up a presentation, or not getting into a club you wanted, failure is kind of like the unofficial syllabus.

I still remember my very first semester, I failed my BEEE end-sem exam. My very first ‘F’ in life. I won’t lie, I cried. Like full-on, “my life is over” crying. Looking back now, it’s funny, but at that time, it felt like the end of the world. Fast forward to my fourth semester, I failed again. This time it was COA (Computer Organization & Architecture). But here’s the difference: I didn’t cry, I just started prepping for the makeup exam, and guess what? I scored decent and actually understood the subject better while studying for the makeup than I did during the actual semester.
Over time you realize there are far greater failures in life than just an F in college. Sometimes you fail because you genuinely didn’t prepare enough, but sometimes it’s because life gets heavy, maybe you’re dealing with personal struggles, grief, or simply too much at once. Either way, a single F isn’t that fatal. 
(Failing in 1–2 subjects is okay, but if you’re failing 4 subjects every semester, you might need real help🙂.)

And then there’s CGPA. Honestly, it’s not a personality trait. Just because someone has a higher pointer doesn’t mean they’re a genius, and a low GPA doesn’t mean you’re dumb. It just means some people are better at cramming or writing 10 pages with “strategically large handwriting.” That’s jugaad. It works for exams, but in the real world, filler doesn’t get you far. I always preferred writing answers that were relevant and to the point. At least I walked away actually understanding something.

But the biggest realization? Grades and failures are just one side of college. The real game is balance, choosing what actually matters. In school, I thought grinding 24/7 was the only way to succeed. By the time I got to college, I realized saying “yes” to everything meant saying “no” to experiences that actually shaped me. So I made time for internship, projects, friends, and things that made me happy. That’s where I grew the most—not just as a student, but as a person.

👉 The real win in college is about learning how to balance, choose wisely, and make time for what actually matters.


## 2. Internships Teach You What College Can’t
My six-month internship taught me more than my entire four years combined. Seriously.
In college, I was used to ppts, assignments, and marks. But in my internship, I had to **actually build things that worked**.

I read research papers, implemented them, understood their working, and applied those ideas to real-world projects. I got to explore tons of new models, frameworks, and libraries, stuff I’d probably never touch in a classroom.
But beyond the technical skills, I also improved my **teamwork skills**. Deadlines, meetings, and group discussions taught me how to communicate, collaborate, and sometimes even compromise. 

College gives you the basics, but internships give you the **context**. They teach you that knowledge alone isn’t enough, you also need problem-solving, teamwork, and the ability to Google/ChatGPT/Claude/Vibe-code your way through bugs at 2 AM.

👉 In college: “Explain this concept for 10 marks.” 
   In internship: “So… can you implement and deploy this by tomorrow?”

(p.s. The Slack notification sound still haunts me—instant mini heart attack every time it popped up!)


## 3. The Right Study Group Changes Everything
This one’s underrated. I’m not talking about the usual “let’s hang out and gossip” squad (you’ll find them everywhere), but a **real study group,** the kind that shares tech stuff, debates project ideas, and actually helps you grow. 🫡

I wasn’t part of some formal “we meet every Friday with notes” kind of setup. But I did have a few classmates with whom I’d talk about new tech updates, their projects, and ideas floating around.
We didn’t meet every week, but whenever we did, the conversations always left me with something new to think about. Sometimes it was a library/framework I’d never heard of, sometimes a cool project idea, and sometimes just a different perspective on solving a problem.
Those discussions gave me motivation during phases when college felt dull and repetitive. It reminded me that learning doesn’t only happen inside classrooms, it happens in random chai breaks, late-night WhatsApp chats, or even quick catch-ups in the corridor.

Having that circle of curious people kept me sharp, and honestly, it shaped my approach to learning way more than rotten notes ever could.


## Looking Back
College wasn’t perfect, it was messy, confusing, and sometimes frustrating. But it taught me things I couldn’t have learnt otherwise: how to fail, how to adapt, how to value time, and most importantly, how to keep learning even outside the classroom.

The real takeaway is the **stories you collect and the skills you build** along the way. That’s what sticks.

👉 College doesn’t hand you all the answers, it just teaches you how to keep asking the right questions.
